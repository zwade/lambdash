<h2>Recursive Types</h2>

In order for us to have more advanced data types, we need to allow them to be recursive. Unfortunately, this opens up a whole host of problems, namely the posibility of an infinitely deep type (<c>type a = type a</c>). In order to mitigate this, we introduct <c>fold</c> and <c>unfold</c> which pack and unpack a recursive type respectively. Let's consider a traditional definition of a list

<codearea data-name="The List">
alias clist = rec l. < `Nil unit + `Cons { `Data int * `Prev l } > in
alias list  =        < `Nil unit + `Cons { `Data int * `Prev clist } > in

fold as clist
`Cons { `Data 3, `Prev (
	fold as clist
	`Cons { `Data 2, `Prev (
		fold as clist
		`Cons { `Data 1, `Prev (
			fold as clist (`Nil () as list)
		)} as list
	)} as list
)} as list
</codearea>

<h2>Recursion</h2>

Now given that list, how can we add up all of its elements and return the value? To do this, we also need a recursive function. For this, we use a <c>fix</c>ed point function.
<codearea data-name="Was a List">
alias clist = rec l. < `Nil unit + `Cons { `Data int * `Prev l } > in
alias list  =        < `Nil unit + `Cons { `Data int * `Prev clist } > in

(
	fix f list: clist returns int.
		case (unfold list) {
			  `Nil u -> 0
			| `Cons r -> r#`Data + (f r#`Prev)
		}
)(
fold as clist
`Cons { `Data 3, `Prev (
	fold as clist
	`Cons { `Data 2, `Prev (
		fold as clist
		`Cons { `Data 1, `Prev (
			fold as clist (`Nil () as list)
		)} as list
	)} as list
)} as list
)
</codearea>

This covers a lot of the important bits of System F. Play around with it and see what you can do!
